        then uses AND NOT(NAND) to clear the bit.

        so bit shifting like (1 << 3) gives us the value at the third bit(starting at 0)
        so 00000100 == 4

        then we might have a number like 6 == 00000110
        AND:ing these numbers gives us

        00000110 &= 00000100 == 00000110

        which isn't very useful because the bit we wanted to change(3rd is still there)
        but adding a negation operation NOT "~" allows us to apply a NOT operation to the bit
        we just retrieved and invert it.

        NOT 00000100 == 11111011
        then we AND them

        00000110 &= 11111011 == 00000100

        since the two bits differ, it'll be set to false or 0
        and thus it is cleared

        Also check out : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate
        what's important in that link is the outcomes in top right.
        since the bit we use from out bitshifting is always on(1)
        if the bit from the number is also on(1)

        it will be set off(set to 0)

        we're going to be using the OR operation.
        which always evaluates to 1 unless both bits are set 0
        1 | 1 == 1
        1 | 0 == 1
        0 | 1 == 1
        0 | 0 == 0
        since the bit we shifted to isn't set to zero, the effect
        is that the operation will always evaluate to 1 and the bit will set.
