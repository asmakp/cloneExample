	/*
		The arguments are just input strings with arbitrary names
		passed as chars because they're supposed to be strings
		and const to indicate that they will not be modified
		in the function

		There are two uses of "*" below(and in function argument)
		1. declaring pointers, "type* var" just means that you declare
		   a pointer of "type"(const unsigned char).
		2. casting a pointer(p1 & p2) from (char*) to (unsigned char*)
		   this just changes the type of the pointer(type being like char, int
		   or float) and the "*" is just there to tell us that it's a pointer.
		   
		   like how you would declare any pointer ex. "int* var;" which declares
		   a pointer of type int.

		   but you could easily pretend the variables weren't pointers in the two lines
		   below if you wanted to because there really isn't any pointer magic going on
		   we're just accessing the type of "p1" & "p2", recasting to unsigned char and
		   storing that in "s1" and "s2".
	*/
	const unsigned char* s1 = (unsigned char*)p1; // recasting p1 pointer type from char to
	const unsigned char* s2 = (unsigned char*)p2; // unsigned and keeping it as a pointer

	/*
		So first off, to understand why we're casting we have to
		get "bare metal"(my teacher looooved saying that) for a sec.

		the basic data types are stored as bytes that are made up
		off bits, 8 bits to be precise.
		so 00001010 are 8 bits that equal 10 in decimal this is
		how the memory cell for "int var = 10;" looks(not really
		they're up to 32 or 64 bits)

		11111111 == 255 -- unsigned char
		01111111 == 127 -- regular old signed char

		unsigned char having a larger range than signed char
		due to not using a bit as a sign(+/-), removing the
		sign increases the range from 127 to 255

		using unsigned char(with a larger range) allows for
		representation of a larger conversion table like
		the extended ASCII table linked below.

		So I see the casting to unsigned char from char
		as a more of an in case or making the function
		safer.

		see
		standard ASCII table http://www.asciitable.com/
		compared to
		Extended ASCII table https://www.ascii-code.com/
		which uses the full range up to 255

		The condition of the while loop in plain english means
		that keep going if the last two read characters match

		so strcmp() compares the first NOT MATCHING characters of two
		strings or EOF and returns the numerical difference(int) giving
		rise to three different possibilites.

		c1 > c2 --> strcmp returns a positive value greater than zero
				

		c1 == c2 --> strings match and strcmp returns zero


		c1 < c2 --> strcmp returns a negative value less than zero

		the greater or less than zero values allow strcmp() to be used
		to sort strings in lexiographical order

		I mostly use it to match strings, never have I had to sort strings
		in this way.
